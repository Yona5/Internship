								Prior to the end of the academic year, ALC made available different full-time internship opportunities
								 for students. After going through the list, I picked the one that I believed suit me and help my future
								  career grow. I filled out the application form and submitted it. Sometime later, I received a congratulatory
								   email saying I was selected from a pool of applicants.

								The first step I took in planning the project was understanding the requirements of the project.
								 I thoroughly read the requirements and eliminated doubts I had about them. The second step was to
								  brainstorm website designs, get inspiration from similar projects, and identify features of the website.
								   Having done that, I moved to making a prototype by sketching the design on paper. The third step was
								    implementing the prototype and getting continues feedback to roll out a better version.

								After taking a break in my home country Ethiopia, I returned to Mauritius to do my internship with ALC.
								ALC has been working in the education sector for two years now and aims “to create a more prosperous 
								and peaceful Africa by developing the next generation of ethical and entrepreneurial African leaders.”
								As a startup, ALC is a small sized company. Roughly it has 200 Employees working in the Mauritius campus.
							    Last year, it inaugurated its Rwanda campus, expanding its horizon to provide quality education.

							<div class="content">
								During my internship, I worked as a teaching assistant. One of my responsibilities was co-facilitating
								 programming classes. Besides co-facilitating, I identified students who need support in and outside of class
								 . As such, I took a different approach towards those students to help them understand concepts they struggled to
								  grasp. To support them further, I run office hours, dedicated times to have a one-on-one conversation with students.
								   In addition, I run dojo classes which offer a platform for students to practice Java.

							<div class="content">
								I see the outcome of the internship in two ways, the knowledge and skills I acquired and the contribution I made.
								 Interning with ALC for three months, I was able to get a real-world work experience and get a sense of where my 
								 career path is heading to. Coming to the contribution I made, I believe I left an impact on the students when it
								  comes to solving programming problems.

							<div class="content">Even though I had a good internship, there were some challenges I faced. Some I was able to solve; some I was not.
								 And the takeaway from it was to learn from the failure and better equip myself to solve similar challenges in the future.
